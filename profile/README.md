## FAQ

#### Q: Why is my meter showing a blank transparent screen when downloaded?
A: Did you press ‚ÄúDraw Meter‚Äù before downloading? If so,
and it still doesn‚Äôt show, please make a bug report in our
public Discord Server.
#### Q: Why do some of the ticks and numbers look weird/not make sense?
A: Check your inputs on what you put - if you don‚Äôt see it
make sense, neither can the code.
#### Q: Who can use MG?
A: Anyone who needs meter decals, whether it be for a 2D
website simulation, your ROBLOX power plant, there is a
wide variety of uses.
#### Q: Can I work/help at MG?
A: No. All MG code is independently done by Mak. However,
suggestions are welcomed and listened to.
#### Q: How can I support MG?
A: You can support by subscribing to my Patreon:
